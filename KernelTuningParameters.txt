1.Command to enable TCP window scaling, which allows clients to download data at a higher rate by enabling extra bits in TCP packets that are used to increase the window size.

net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1

2.Command to enable TCP SYN cookies, which is often enabled by default and is extremely effective in preventing conditions such as SYN floods that can drain the server of resources used to process incoming connections.

net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

3.Below options increase the TCP send and receive buffers, which allow an application to move its data out faster so as to serve other requests. This also improves the client's ability to send data to the server when it gets busy.

net.core.rmem_max = 16777216

net.core.wmem_max = 16777216

net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 16777216

net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 16777216
